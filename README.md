# Lambda School Sprint Challenges

This repo contains my work on Sprint Challenges from Lambda School. Sprint challenges are 3-hour coding exercises testing knowledge in a wide variety of machine learning topics. These challenges were completed in a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) environment; note that some visual formatting can vary substantitally between Colab and Github.
